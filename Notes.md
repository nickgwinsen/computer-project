Since u.gg works based off of its massive amount of data that they use, I will make the search feature for a champion based more off of champion abilities, lore, tips, and recommended builds maybe.

For the builds feature, I will implement a crowdsourced build where users can vote on their favorite build and submit to the champion's page. (An account must be had for this.)
